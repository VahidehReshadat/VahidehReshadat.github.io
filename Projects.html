I have actively participated in the following projects:<br />
<b>2020-present (as Postdoc researcher):</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <h3>LARA (Lane Analysis and Route Advisor)</h3> The project is related to the optimization of route planning for global air freight shipments, specifically for products with special handling needs, such as temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals with the application of advanced data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I mainly contributed in WP1 and WP2.
<br />
<b>WP 1:</b> Develop a concept for a search engine to determine the available routing options for a shipment with specific handling needs.<br />
<b>WP 2:</b> Develop an AI-based decision support system that evaluates and compares different routing options for shipments and recommends the optimal routings.
<br />
